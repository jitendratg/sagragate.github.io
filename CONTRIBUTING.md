# Hot to work with Sagra prototype

### Keep in mind

1. If you want or need to install any additional third party javascript please suggest first. We will decide what should be installed.
2. We are trying to make everything without jQuery. Please avoid to use it if possible. If it is not possible or simply not does not make sense to avoid, also discuss. In the mean time you can include jQuery in in `assets/vendors` directory.
3. When you work with files with some code already, try not to change indent or other formatting. Becaue if you commit it, it creates a lot of changes where changes was not actually done. It is hard to keep track of changes.

### Workflow
